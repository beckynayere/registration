# npm resolution error report

While resolving: @angular-devkit/build-angular@16.2.0
Found: @angular/compiler-cli@11.0.5
node_modules/@angular/compiler-cli
  dev @angular/compiler-cli@"^11.0.5" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer @angular/compiler-cli@"^16.0.0" from @angular-devkit/build-angular@16.2.0
node_modules/@angular-devkit/build-angular
  dev @angular-devkit/build-angular@"^16.2.0" from the root project

Conflicting peer dependency: @angular/compiler-cli@16.2.0
node_modules/@angular/compiler-cli
  peer @angular/compiler-cli@"^16.0.0" from @angular-devkit/build-angular@16.2.0
  node_modules/@angular-devkit/build-angular
    dev @angular-devkit/build-angular@"^16.2.0" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
